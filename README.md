# firestore-batcher

The easier way to do batched write operations for Cloud Firestore.

```bash
npm install firestore-batcher
```

```typescript
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase-admin/app'
import { FieldValue, getFirestore, Timestamp } from 'firebase-admin/firestore'
import createBatcher, { deleteOperation } from 'firestore-batcher'

const app = initializeApp()
const db = getFirestore()

const batcher = createBatcher(db)

async function bulkDelete() {
    const finishedTodosQuery = db
        .collection('todos')
        .where('finished', '==', true)

    await batcher.all(finishedTodosQuery, (todoRef) => deleteOperation(todoRef))
}

bulkDelete()
```

## Description

Using _batches_ is the recommended way of performing Firestore write operations in bulk, like [deleting a collection](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/delete-data#collections).

There are some considerations you need to make when using `batch`, that this library will handle for you:

-   A batch has an upper limit of 500 operations. If you need more operations, you need to make more batches.
-   Even if you stick to less than 500 ops/batch, a batch might fail due to "Transaction is too big", depending of the size of the data.

This tool will run batches recursively on your operations. The batch size is changed dynamically to handle "Transaction too big" errors.

In the following example we see that a "Transaction too big" error occurred, and the batch size was halved to 250. After that, the batch size was gradually restored to its former glory by a factor of 1.5.

```
Batch committed. Batch size: 500. Processed: 15013. Queued: 0. Progress: 1
Batch committed. Batch size: 500. Processed: 15513. Queued: 0. Progress: 1
Batch committed. Batch size: 250. Processed: 15763. Queued: 250. Progress: 0.9843876850059327
Batch committed. Batch size: 375. Processed: 16013. Queued: 0. Progress: 1
Batch committed. Batch size: 500. Processed: 16513. Queued: 0. Progress: 1
Batch committed. Batch size: 500. Processed: 17013. Queued: 0. Progress: 1
```

## API

The default export is a function that takes a `firestore` instance, and perhaps some options, and returns a `Batcher` instance.

### `createBatcher` function

```
(db, options?) => Batcher
```

```typescript
import * as firebase from 'firestore-admin'
import createBatcher, { deleteOperation } from 'firestore-batcher'

const app = firebase.initializeApp()
const db = firebase.firestore()

const options = {
    onBatchCommitted: (stats) =>
        console.log(
            `Committed a batch. Total ops processed: ${stats.operationsProcessed}.`,
        ),
}

const batcher = createBatcher(db)
```

#### `db` (`firestore.Firestore`)

An instance of Firestore.

#### `BatcherOptions` object

Optional. An object of optional options for the batcher.

##### `onBatchCommitted`

`(stats: BatcherStats) => void`

A callback function that is called every time a batch is committed. Is called with the current stats.

### Batcher

An object with various methods:

#### `add` function

`<T>(operation: Operation<T>) => void`

Adds an operation on a single document to the batch queue. Make sure you call `batcher.commit()` at least onceÂ after using this.

Example

```typescript
const lotr = db.collection('books').doc('lord-of-the-rings')
const batcher.add(updateOperation(lotr, { read: true }))
const harry = db.collection('books').doc('harry-potter')
batcher.add(deleteOperation(harry))
await batcher.commit()
```

#### `all` function

`(query: FirebaseFirestore.Query<DocumentData>, operationBuilder: <T>(doc: DocumentReference<T>) => Operation<T>) => Promise<void>`

This function takes a query and a callback. The query will be limited according to `batchSize`, and fetched and committed recursively.

Example:

```typescript
const finishedTodosQuery = db.collection('todos').where('finished', '==', true)

await batcher.all(finishedTodosQuery, (todoRef) => deleteOperation(todoRef))
```

If we imagine there are 1337 finished todos, the above code will first fetch 500, delete them, fetch 500 more, delete them, fetch 337 and delete them.

This method will commit each batch, so there is no need to call `batcher.commit()` yourself.

#### `commit` function

`() => Promise<void>`

Commits all queued operations recursively, using multiple batches if necessary.

#### `stats` function

```
() => BatcherStats
```

Returns the current stats.

### Operations

```
type Operation<T> = CreateOperation<T> | DeleteOperation<T> | SetOperation<T> | UpdateOperation<T>
```

An _operation_ is an object that represents a batch write operation (create, set, update or delete) on a specific document.

Four helper methods are exported to create these operation objects:

#### createOperation

```
<T>(documentRef: firestore.DocumentReference<T>, data: T) => CreateOperation<T>
```

Creates a new document.

#### deleteOperation

```
<T>(documentRef: firestore.DocumentReference<T>, precondition?: FirebaseFirestore.Precondition) => DeleteOperation<T>
```

Deletes a document.

#### setOperation

```
<T>(documentRef: firestore.DocumentReference<T>, data: T) => SetOperation<T>
```

Sets the data for a document.

#### updateOperation

```
<T>(documentRef: firestore.DocumentReference<T>, data: T, precondition?: FirebaseFirestore.Precondition) => UpdateOperation<T>
```

Updates parts of a document.

### BatcherStats

```
{
    batchSize: number,
    operationsProcessed: number,
    operationsQueued: number,
}
```
